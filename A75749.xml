            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The latter hath nothing in it worth my anſwer, nor thy note, but that it is meerly fictitious, falſe <hi>In toto, &amp; in qualibet parte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never any ſuch Petition ſeen in Cheſhire, never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the houſe, noe ſuch perſons ever ſigned it.</p>
                  <p>For thy better ſatisfaction, know we have but five Noblemen in Cheſhire, four of which, ſigned the firſt Petition; of Knights Baronets, Knights, and Eſquires, I know not above two in the whole County, that do deſire the abolition of the Epiſcopall order, we have not in all ſo many Divines, as are ſaid to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writ,
<pb facs="tcp:156939:5"/> and fourſcore and ten of thoſe have ſigned the Remonſtrance, moſt of the reſt were never asked. And for the Gentry and inhabitants, I do confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not one of either, but will proteſt againſt that Libell, not one of a hundred, but (that queſtion being ſinglely ſtated, whether they deſire the continuance of Biſhops, or to ſubmit to a Presbytery) will with their hands witneſſe their hearts affections to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that order, eſtabliſhed by our Laws, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of which Laws, muſt preſerve the continuation of our liberties.</p>
                  <p>But thou wilt leſſe admire his boldneſſe to traduce a Countrey, when thou ſhalt finde him ſo impudent as to belie the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>To delude the (ignorant or negligent) Reader, he ſtuffs his Margin full of Texts, of which thou ſhalt not finde one for his purpoſe: He takes upon him to prove, that the Apoſtles alwayes ordained ſundry Biſhops in every particular Congregation, and thoſe of equall power and authority: for proofe whereof, he quotes <hi>Act</hi> 11.30.<note place="margin">Acts 11. verſe 27, 28, 29, 30. C. a lapide, Acts 11.31.</note> but take the precedent verſes with it, and ſee what thou canſt conclude thence <hi>(a.) And in thoſe days came Prophets from Hieruſalem to Antioch, and there ſtood up one of them named Agabus, and ſignified by the Spirit that there ſhould be great dearth, thorowout all the world, which came to paſſe in the dayes of Claudius Caeſar. Then the Diſciples every man aecording to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility determined to ſend relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Iudea, which alſo they did, and ſent it to the Elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which it is very probable, as is the opinion of <hi>C. a Lapide,</hi> and others, was chiefly meant the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Nec alia tunc fuit Diaconorum ratio, quam ſub Apoſtolis oblationes enim fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium quotidianas et anuos Eccleſiae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus recipiebant ut conferent in veros, uſus, id eſt partim Miniſtris, partim pauperibus, alendis diſtribuerent.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Oath in Courts Leet and Baron is</hi> uſually adminiſtred without limitation, and before the charge be given, ſo that the <hi>Jurors</hi> cannot ſweare in judgement as the Lord requires they ſhould.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the Countie Court</hi> is kept upon the Munday, and thereby we are put unto exceſſive charges in travelling thereto, unleſſe wee ſhould labour upon the Lords day next before.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that our Countrie is verie deſtitute <hi>of ſufficient Schoolemaſters</hi> for the educating of our Children, and fitting them for the ſervice of God, our King, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, that there are ſuch <hi>exceſſive fines</hi> by ſome Gentlemen impoſed upon their Tenants, as that thereby they are both diſabled to maintaine their families, (whence ariſeth ſo many poore people) and to doe his Majeſtie ſervice, and pay him lawfull tribute.</p>

                     <salute>Reverend Fathers,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN the firſt part of this Diſcourſe, I have had a particular Intereſt, us'd the liberty of my owne expreſſions out of the ſenſe and fore-ſight of my owne endangered Liberty; which I apprehend abſolutely to depend upon the preſervation of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated order and Legall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to be inevitably, if not irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably, loſt by the admiſſion of an irregular, Arbitrary Presbytery. I denie not but the wiſedome of this Age may finde out a new way, neither pattern'd by the Apoſtles, nor practiz'd in any Age or State; and when it is eſtabliſhed by Law, I know my part, obedience: But till then, Law being on my ſide, God forbid I ſhould not as freely ſpeak in defence of fundamentall Lawes, of Divine inſtitutions, as others doe to the ſubverſion of both.</p>
                  <p>Such has beene the unhappineſſe of my Privacie, I am ſcarce knowne to, hardly know any of, your perſons: yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156939:14"/> with that Reverence doe I looke upon your Sacred order as an Apoſtolicall, therefore not queſtionable inſtitution. I conſider your Predeceſſours as the Ballaſt which have poyz'd the Barks of Monarchy, to ſayle ſafely in the Sea of Vulgar, whoſe piety and wiſedome firſt preſcribed the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium twixt Tyrannie and Anarchy. Till Biſhops help'd to reduce the unbounded wills of Princes to the limits of Lawes, Kings were Tyrants: And where ever they are not, there ever followes a popular (which is a worſe Tyranny.) Obedience to Kings, Conformity to Lawes, is a Duty both to God and nature, but ſubjection to the abſolute and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited wills of men is unnaturall to thoſe that were borne under the protection of Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Long ha's this Nation flouriſhed in the equall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lawes, by Divines, Civilians, and Common Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers; Glorious and fortunate have beene the Proficients in all of them; They much deceive themſelves that think the one ſhall riſe by the fall of the other two.</p>
                  <p>If two or three mixt Arbitrary Courts, ſitting onely in Tearme time, ſhall be thought ſo prejudiciall to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, what muſt a Quotidian-Chancery prove in every Pariſh? Sure hee that ſhould but ſeriouſly conſider the condition of the Advocates in the <hi>Low Countries, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> and in all places where the Presbytery hath got foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would burne his Barr Gowne, and begin a new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, at the apprehenſion of ſuch a change. No doubt <hi>Rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> At this inſtant, there are many able men ready to ſupply your voyded ſeates, and an inſtant extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment of all the lights of the Church cannot be fear'd. But if all preferment for humane learning ſhall be thus taken away, in the next Age wee are liker to degenerate to the Barbariſme of the Greekes then arive at their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The ſword hath for a ſhort ſpace kept ſome States a float, but I muſt boldly ſay, tis the Reverence of Religion, the advancement of learning, that hath made
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156939:14"/> them ſtable and happy. Theſe Conſiderations are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly within the capacity of a Gentleman; But in the latter part I muſt ask your pardon, That I have walk'd beyond my Verge; Taken as well a Divine as a politique Survey of your order. I know it is an Injurie to plead a good cauſe ill, yet I hope you will finde my Modeſty ſuch, that in this I preſume ſo little of my ſelfe, that I have onely allowed words to knit together the opinions of ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities as till now have beene Authentique. 'Tis a time when ſelfe-intereſt ſwayes much, and (for ought I know) every man that reads this, may be equally concern'd as my ſelfe; whereby, this muſt be conceived leſſe partiall from me, then from any of your Coat. And at leaſt they will inferre hence, that much more might be ſaid, ſince I have ſaid ſo much. I muſt confeſſe enough hath beene delivered in a little by that Reverend Primate <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher; T'is Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi> Which admitted, the Concluſion ſilences all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra negantes principia non diſputandum,</hi> Does well in Schooles; but when noyſe and novelty onely prevaile, I wiſh you had been all more free in defence of your Calling. 'Tis truth, that <hi>Downam, Bilſon, Suckliffe,</hi> and many others, have ſaid ſo much, as there can ſcarce be any thing added, but they muſt have new Titles, or elſe they will not be look'd on, the Fathers themſelves are abſolete and deſerted Authority. Wee are all growne ſo wiſe in this knowing Age, that every man muſt have his proofes level'd to his owne naturall reaſon: unleſſe they be invectives; thoſe tickle the <hi>itching eares</hi> of the time, and are preſently taken upon truſt, without examination. I was not fram'd to court that ſtraine; nor doe I expect to pleaſe your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners; all my ambition is to ſatisfie ſome Gentlemen free as my ſelfe; my Deſire is not to offend you, by the ill mannage of ſo good a Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Though I know none by any of you, yet ſhould I not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156939:15"/> ſeek to qualifie the ill of any of your perſons. But muſt profeſſe I affectionately pray, for the Conſervation of that order which is ſo apt an Embleme of the Divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of that great Creator; who as hee ordained, the Sunne to exceed the Moone, The Moone the Starres, and every Starre excelling another in glory, Doubtleſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as divine a Method in diſpoſing the lights of our immortall ſoules, as thoſe Luminaries of our corruptible bodies. Hee I hope will preſerve this Church, while that Sunne and Moone endure. Which is the prayer of</p>

                  <p>WEe have lately received a Printed Copie, of a moſt ſeditious, feigned, and dangerouſly factious Petition, which is ſpread in the County, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting to be preferred to the High and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Court of Parliament, by the Nobles, Knights, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, Miniſters, &amp;c. of this County; (pretended) in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a Petition, ſubſcribed by us and many thouſands more, and by our requeſt preferred by you for the good and honour of this County; which vile and Machivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Petition, we perceive was never preferred to neither Houſe, but diſperſed maliciouſly and ſeditiouſly to ſtirre up diſcord and tumult. And wee have alſo ſeene the Coppie of your Petition preferred on the behalfe, and for the ſervice of this County for whom you are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in this, Which wee all ſo well approve of, as wee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156939:16"/> doubt not, but that as well thoſe many thouſands who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed our <hi>Remonstrance</hi> preferred by you (which found ſo gracious acceptation both with his Sacred Majeſtie, and the Lords to whom it was preferred) as alſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more of this County, whoſe hands could not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſhortneſſe of time be gotten to that, will upon juſt opportunity acknowledge your good ſervice herein for your Country, and your merit from the Inhabitants thereof who ſtand well affected, either to his Majeſtie, or the good or peaceable Government of this Kingdome. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee have not onely thought fit with theſe few ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers (whom the ſhortneſſe of this diſpatch could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge your merits unto) to teſtifie your great Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence for your Country, and our approbation thereof, but to pray you, not to be diſcouraged herein; But ſtil to preſſe, as there ſhall be oportunity, an effectuall order and anſwer to our <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> and ſome courſe, as the great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Lords aſſembled ſhall think meet, to check the further growth of theſe Seditious Inſolences, and attempts to caſt aſperſions upon our Loyall intentions, and diſturb the peace of our Church and ſtate Government: wherein wee have alſo addreſſed our thankfulneſſe and Humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to the moſt Honorable <hi>Earle of Bath,</hi> which we ſhall beſeech you the rather more ſpeedily to deliver, becauſe here are daily more Innovations by the importunity of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe Schiſmes, and factions, ſo that much ill is to be feared, if a timely prevention be not given to the growth thereof.

                     <p>'Twas a ſigne of no good intent, when ſuch a petition muſt bee ſmother'd up from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Counſells of the Gentrie: And though it were ſuppreſt after it had beene ſpread abroad, as (perhaps) finding the times not ripe for a full diſcovery of their occult deſignes: yet (to thoſe that will ſee) it gives light enough, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of Reforming the Church, the true aime of ſuch ſpirits is to ſhake off the yoke of all obedience, either to Eccleſiaſticall, Civill, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Statute, or the Cuſtomarie Lawes of the Kingdome, and to introduce a meere Arbitrary Government.</p>
                     <p>But it may perhaps be ſaid, this is but the fancy of ſome diſtempered <hi>Zelots</hi> in that part onely: and that I doe but raiſe a ſhadow and fight with it: let ſuch compare well the harmonie of other licentious raylers (whoſe pamphlets garniſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtall) and the concurrence of thoſe of the ſame ſtraine in the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> with the preſent poſitions and petition complained of; and I dare promiſe they

<pb facs="tcp:156939:39"/> Monarchy, we can finde nothing incongruous to the faith or liberty of a true Proteſtant. But wee ſee our ſelves bound by Oath to acknowledge and ſupport that Regall Government our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes have eſtabliſh'd, our Lawes approved: Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie repreſents moſt happy, policy recommends as ſafeſt, to which all proteſtant Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe due allegeance: All Primitive times yielded full obedience, To whoſe Throne Chriſt himſelfe yields Tribute, To whoſe power he commands ſubmiſſion and reverence; To whoſe juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is committed the deſignation of Biſhops and Judges, whoſe perſons God will have ſacred, whoſe Actions unqueſtionable, whoſe ſucceſſion he himſelfe determines, whoſe Kingdomes hee diſpoſes, and whoſe Election is the All-Makers ſole prerogative.</p>
                     <p>Now whether theſe Crownes and Scepters ſhall be held <hi>Jure Divino</hi> or not, I take not on me to determine: but I may be bold to deliver <hi>Du-Moulins</hi> owne words,<note n="x" place="margin">Moulins Buckler of Faith. <hi>fol.</hi> 560.</note> 
                        <hi>Whoſoever buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the authority of Kings upon mens inſtitutions, and not upon the Ordinance of God, cutteth off three parts of their authoritie, and bereaveth them of that which aſſureth their Lives and their Crowns more than the guards of their bodies, or puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant armie, which put terrour into ſubjects hearts, inſtead of framing them to obedience: Then the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of ſubjects will be firme and ſure, when it ſhall be incorporated into piety, and eſteemed to be a part of Religion, and of the ſervice which men owe to God.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:156939:65"/> flowers of others planting; onely having taken ſome paines to pleaſe and ſatisfie my ſelfe, I ſhall be glad if any man elſe can reap any content out of my labours. <hi>Et tu confirmatus, confirma fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, was Chriſtian Counſell,</hi> and I confeſſe had I power to doe it, I would draw all the world to my opinion; that is to reverence their Calling, preſerve their Order, yet with as free a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as reſpectleſſe of their perſons, ſubmit to the exemplar puniſhment of ſuch as ſtaine the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Coat, entrench upon our Liberties, negligently ſtarve their flock, covetouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe the meanes of faithfull Labourers, or with their Novelties diſtract the Church, as any man that lives.</p>
